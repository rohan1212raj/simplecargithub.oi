        <p>Jeep is an American automobile manufacturer which was founded in 1943. The company was acquired by the Chrysler brand in 1987, and is currently owned by Stellantis, a European-American conglomerate. <br>The SUV-maker entered the Indian market in 2016 with the introduction of the Grand Cherokee and the Wrangler in the country, which were imported into the country through the CBU route. The company later launched the Compass compact SUV in the country back in April 2017 and is manufactured at the FCA facility in Ranjangaon, near Pune, Maharashtra. The same facility is also used for the production of export-spec models of the Compass which are shipped to various RHD markets</p>

        <p>In India, Jeep currently sells the Compass, which is manufactured locally, followed by the Wrangler, which is a Completely Knocked Down (CKD) unit. The company is also working on a new seven-seat SUV based on the Compass, which is known as the Commander globally, but is likely to be called the Meridian in India upon launch. </p><br>
